Cozy Tea Project by Code Academy. In this project, I was given a spec to follow. I left the colors on the project to highlight the importance of not quitting. The first attempt, I wrote all of html without any thought of CSS which left the project incomplete. After taking a moment to come up with a different approach, I decided to tackle the spec by sections.  When implementing css style tools I used colors to outline each section to ensure that I maintain the integrity of the project checking the wrap and responsive designs.
